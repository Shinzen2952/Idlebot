<pre>
The website idle community was made for those who are the world's future scientific prodigies, and
you may use it for a variety of purposes, including chatting with your friends, posting on forums,and more.
Discuss and debate various hypotheses in a group setting. Additionally, because people can debate a wide range of 
scientific topics on this platform and because it is about the cosmos and our universe, now is the greatest moment 
to make science more fun. Additionally, this has potential value since theoretical physicists, scientists, and 
theorists may find great need for this in the future. Additionally, anybody may publish on idle websites.
